            <h3>Erick</h3>
            <p>Erick is a passionate advocate for men's mental health and the co-founder of Raw Minds on Men's Mental Health, a podcast that takes an honest, unfiltered approach to discussing the real struggles men face. Based in Vancouver, BC, Erick brings a deeply personal perspective to his work. After overcoming significant challenges in his life, including a difficult past in his youth, Erick is now committedto using his experiences to help others.

Erick’s perspective on life and death has been shaped by the many losses he’s endured, including the deaths of his best friend and fiancée. These experiences have given him a unique outlook on death, which he shares through the open and heartfelt conversations on Raw Minds. While he has worked through the impacts of PTSD, his journey continues to influence his approach to mental health advocacy.

Through Raw Minds, Erick creates a space for men to speak openly about issues such as depression, anxiety, and relationships. His raw, honest discussions encourage others to seek support and embrace vulnerability, helping to break down the stigmas surrounding mental health.

Erick's passion for this work drives him, and he feels that Raw Minds is the purpose he was always meant to pursue. Outside of the podcast, Erick is a dedicated father, outdoor enthusiast, and proud dog dad to his American pocket bully, Kova.</p>
